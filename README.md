# Employee Management System

## Overview

This project aims to develop an Employee Management System using Spring Boot, facilitating basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records. The application interfaces with a relational database to store and manage employee data. Additionally, caching mechanisms are implemented to optimize read operations, enhancing overall system performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Apache Maven
- MySQL or PostgreSQL database server

### Setting Up the Application

1. Initialize a Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr, including the following dependencies:
   - Spring Web
   - Spring Data JPA
   - Spring Boot DevTools
   - Database connector (MySQL or PostgreSQL)

2. Configure the database connection properties in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

## Database Integration

### Employee Entity

Define the **Employee** class annotated with `@Entity` to map to a database table.

### Repository Interface

Create a repository interface that extends `JpaRepository`, providing CRUD operations on the Employee entity.

### REST Controllers

Implement a RestController class with mappings for various CRUD operations.

## Implementing Caching

### Adding Dependencies

Add the 'Spring Boot Starter Cache' dependency to the project.

### Enabling Caching

Annotate one of your configuration classes with `@EnableCaching` to enable caching.

### Implementing Caching

- Use `@Cacheable` on methods to cache the result of read operations.
- Use `@CacheEvict` to remove entries from the cache when an employee record is updated or deleted.

### Configuring Cache Manager

Define a cache manager bean in your configuration to specify caching behavior.

## Additional Enhancements and Learning Points

- **Error Handling**: Implement global error handling to manage exceptions gracefully.
- **Security**: Integrate Spring Security to control access to API endpoints.
- **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests using JUnit and Mockito to ensure application logic correctness.
- **Performance Measurement**: Utilize tools like Spring Boot Actuator to monitor application health and performance metrics.
